        <p>When I first visited this park, I thought nothing special about this place. This park was just like any other ordinary park I've been to before. It's a park located in a very crowded and diverse place in Brooklyn, by where I live. There were kids, there were teens and there were adults all doing their own things in this park, but what I didn't know was that there was a community being built within. As I continued to go to this park more, I felt more connected to this place, as I slowly saw the community being built there.</p>
        <p>The feel of the grass, the feel of the concrete. It was an open field with a basketball court and a playground. The feeling of freedom filled the kids as they leapt across the field, running away from their parents and towards the swings, eagerly waiting to be pushed. In the soccer area, there were people cheering and shouting “goal” after every time someone scored a goal. The feeling of grass brushing against your ankles as you walked across the field, wishing that someone would cut the grass shorter. The breeze of the wind messing up your hair as you run across the open field while playing tag with another kid. The sound of ice cream trucks passing by, watching as all the kids chase after it, begging for their parents to buy them ice cream. One side of the field filled with old asian grandmas and grandpas stretching, doing their daily workout routine, while the others played checkers or chess while a group of people crowded on top of them as they watched them play.</p>
        <p>I remember as a kid I would come here everyday, after school. I remember seeing other kids like me having fun on the playground and the “big people” playing basketball. I would join in with the other kids my age occasionally and we would race each other, climbing up the slides or swinging across the monkey bars. I remember begging my parents for ice cream after a sweaty time at the park.</p>
        <p>The park hasn't changed much throughout my childhood. There are still grandmas and grandpas, little kids and teens all still here at the park, if not more. Now as a teen I still go there from time to time overwhelmed by the feeling of nostalgia, watching as kids that I was once before, enjoying life and feeling carefree.</p>
        <p>The community at Dyker Park is still great. Even today, I still continue to go and have fun as I  build bonds with people. Like many places in New York, people manage to connect with each other even when they're strangers. This park brings the people in this neighborhood together as they all strive to create a strong, tight community within.</p>
        <p>This place really means a lot to me, this was the park I grew up playing in, and watched the community grow as I grew. This park symbolizes another home for me, everyone being very friendly, nice and always looking out for each other. You can feel very safe here knowing that people in the park or around this neighborhood would help you out if you need anything. I have been to many other parks, but none of them has this many kind-hearted people in their community like this one.</p>
